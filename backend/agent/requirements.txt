# Voice Agent Dependencies
#
# NOTE: These dependencies are installed in the WORKER service, not orchestrator.
# The agent runs as a subprocess spawned by Celery workers.
#
# This file documents agent-specific dependencies and is included in
# backend/worker/requirements.txt during worker Docker build.
#
# Do NOT remove this file - it serves as the canonical reference for
# what the voice agent subprocess needs to run.
